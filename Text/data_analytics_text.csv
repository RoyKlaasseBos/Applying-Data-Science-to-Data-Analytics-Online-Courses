Why train a neural network to learn about the data in a database, when you can train a neural network to interact with the real-world?,While deep reinforcement learning and AI has a lot of potential, it also carries with it huge risk.,Bill Gates and Elon Musk have made public statements about some of the risks that AI poses to economic stability and even our existence.,As we learned in my first reinforcement learning course, one of the main principles of training reinforcement learning agents is that there are unintended consequences when training an AI.,AIs don’t think like humans, and so they come up with novel and non-intuitive solutions to reach their goals, often in ways that surprise domain experts - humans who are the best at what they do.,OpenAI is a non-profit founded by Elon Musk, Sam Altman (Y Combinator), and others, in order to ensure that AI progresses in a way that is beneficial, rather than harmful.,Part of the motivation behind OpenAI is the existential risk that AI poses to humans.

It allows creativity and gives freedom to explore, understand, design, and share. Tableau doesn’t lock you into a single path to a solution. Tableau designers feel like artists with data as paint and Tableau as a blank canvas. Tableau's uniqueness comes from its paradigm. Tableau is different from traditional BI products that force you to select a chart type and then match data to various components of the chart. You won't be confronted with wizards or pre-built dashboards that give you some insight at first but fail to deliver additional insight when you need it. Instead, Tableau allows hands-on interaction with data; it's easy to get into a flow of asking questions, uncovering new insights, raising new questions and answers, and finally designing a data story to share with others. The aim of this course is to equip you with the concepts and practical applications that will allow you to use Tableau to explore, analyze, visualize, and share the stories contained in your data. Beginning with the fundamentals, such as data preparation, you’ll soon learn how to build and customize your own data visualizations and dashboards, essential for high-level visibility and effective data storytelling. The course will show how to build basic charts in Tableau and moves on to building more complex charts by incorporating different Tableau features and interactivity components . Next, you’ll learn to perform different calculations such as row-level, aggregate-level, Level of Details , and table calculations. You'll learn the key concepts behind calculations and how they work in Tableau. You’ll also find out how to do trend analysis and forecasting using clustering and distribution models to inform your analytics. But it’s not just about you – when it comes to data it’s all about availability and access. That’s why we’ll show you how to share your Tableau visualizations. It’s only once insights are shared and communicated that you – and your organization – will start making smarter and informed decisions. And really, that’s exactly what this course is for. By the end of this course, you’ll know how to analyze and communicate data and insights more efficiently and effectively by creating compelling interactive charts, dashboards, and stories in Tableau.,Meet Your Experts:,Donabel Santos is a self-confessed data geek.

Such developers will be working on applications that can benefit from text analysis, whether from providing more sophisticated processing of user input, or adding analytical capabilities to enhance the user's understanding of an application's data sets. The viewer is assumed to have a working knowledge of Java.","Natural Language Processing (NLP) is used in many applications to provide capabilities that were previously not possible. It involves analyzing text to obtain the intent and meaning, which can then be used to support an application. Using NLP within an application requires a combination of standard Java techniques and often specialized libraries frequently based on models that have been trained. You need to know what is available, how these technologies can be used, and when they should be used. In this course we will cover the essence of NLP using Java. This video course will commence by walking you through basic NLP tasks including data acquisition, data cleaning, finding parts of text, and determining the end of sentences. These serve as the basis for other NLP tasks such as classifying text and determining the relationship between text elements. This will be followed by the use of tokenization techniques. Tokenization is used for almost all NLP tasks. You will learn how text can be split to reveal information such as names, dates, and even the grammatical structure of a sentence. These types of activity can lead to insights into the relationships between text elements and embedded meaning in a document.

This course, and the courses that follow, are useful for both beginner and intermediate R programmers who want to understand the unique features of R and why ""R works the way it does."" I have been using, teaching, and writing applications in R for 6 years and have come to appreciate that R is a beautiful and elegant language that is especially well-suited for writing applications for data analytics, and for mathematical and statistical applications. Furthermore, R is superior in terms of inherent graphical data presentation capabilities that go hand-in-hand with exploring and understanding data relationships.,Most introductory R courses, those that do not directly address sharpening one's R programming skills, first teach the important R data structures, then the basics of R functions, and generally the use of base R graphics capabilities. However, these introductory R courses are not targeted at the R programmer population, but rather at the general R user population. This course, Practical Foundations of R Programming , which contains all-unique material compared to my other Udemy R courses, addresses R data structures, R subsetting, and R functions, but from the focused perspective of someone who intends to write efficient higher-level applications using R. It is specifically intended to teach the most important foundation concepts and features of the R programming language which are necessary to understand to write efficient and effective applications in R.,This course, which is exclusively ""hands-on,"" demonstrates the construction and use of R code within the RStudio IDE, and focuses on the unique features of R that can make writing applications in R both a challenge and a delight. The course does not present a single power point slide and relies heavily on user exercises. In each of the three major sections of the course, (1) data structures, (2) subsetting, and (3) functions, there are multiple sets of within-section exercises, as well as a final end-of-section exercise set. Participants are encouraged to complete each set of exercises ""on their own"" before they view the videos that present the exercise solutions. All course videos, and all exercises, as well as their solutions, are presented within R scripts that are made accessible with the course materials. Anything and everything that you see me demonstrate and/or discuss in the 100+ course videos are available for you to download at the beginning of the course.,The second course in this learning path, which should be available to you by the time you complete this first course, will delve more deeply into functional programming in R per se. The second course will have a similar format to this first course: all ""hands-on"" with extensive use of practical and relevant in-section, and end-of-section, exercises.","You should have previously installed and used R software and RStudio,It is helpful if you have already written some code in R or in other programming languages","https://www.udemy.com/practical-foundations-of-r-programming/","Understand the most important concepts relating to data structures, subsetting, and writing functions in R"

Practitioners working in the field of business analysis apply a wide range of modelling tools to capture the various perspectives of the enterprise, for example, business process perspective, data flow perspective, functional perspective, static structure perspective, and more. These tools aid in decision support and are especially useful in the effort towards the transformation of a business into the ""intelligent enterprise"", in other words, one which is to some extent ""self-describing"" and able to adapt to organisational change.,However, a fundamental piece remains missing from the puzzle. Achieving this capability requires us to think beyond the idea of simply using the current mainstream modelling tools. Instead, we need to take into account methods that provide a basis for sharing meaning at both human and computational level, and that are geared to capturing the semantics (i.e. the meaning) of entities that describe our enterprise perspectives. This is where the concept of ontologies come in. Ontologies are representations that provide a basis for sharing meaning at human and computational level, and are an invaluable addition to any business analyst's toolkit.,Ontologies help you formally represent domain knowledge that is accurate and reusable, which aligns very well with your reuse strategy for enterprise knowledge. Ontologies are platform-agnostic knowledge models and building them does not require you to have any extensive technical or software engineering skills. This means that as business analyst, you are able to produce the blueprints for any system or software design project, allowing you to more rapidly prototype information structures and test them out before passing your specifications over to software engineers to implement. Consequently, ontology modelling empowers business analysts as information and knowledge architects.,In addition, ontologies are extremely relevant to the area of information systems interoperability, providing you with the mechanisms to drive semantic data exchange and federation across multiple information sources and repositories. They can also be extended into structured knowledge bases for constantly-evolving linked data that have complex relationships and are held in dynamic schemas, thereby responding very well to changes in organisational knowledge. The thing is - that's just a glimpse of some of the useful benefits of ontologies from a business analysis standpoint - ontologies, in practice, do much more than that!,Unfortunately, ontology modelling is an underused technique chiefly as a result of a lack of awareness in the industry domain, and because tool support has been relatively limited in the past. But this course is intended to be a game changer, focusing on providing a comprehensive introduction to ontologies in the context of business analysis application, in order to encourage the adoption of the approach. The material provided in the course covers relevant background information to get comfortable with the concepts being explained, the justifications for applying ontologies in business analysis practice, walkthrough examples, and other important details that are pertinent for you to be able to hit the ground running with using ontologies within your own business analysis pipeline.

The focus, and majority of content, of this course is on generalized additive modeling. Anyone who wishes to learn how to specify, estimate and interpret GAMs would especially benefit from this course.","Linear Regression, GLMs and GAMs with R demonstrates how to use R to extend the basic assumptions and constraints of linear regression to specify, model, and interpret the results of generalized linear (GLMs) and generalized additive (GAMs) models. The course demonstrates the estimation of GLMs and GAMs by working through a series of practical examples from the book Generalized Additive Models: An Introduction with R by Simon N. Wood (Chapman & Hall/CRC Texts in Statistical Science, 2006). Linear statistical models have a univariate response modeled as a linear function of predictor variables and a zero mean random error term. The assumption of linearity is a critical (and limiting) characteristic. Generalized linear models (GLMs) relax this assumption of linearity. They permit the expected value of the response variable to be a smoothed (e.g. non-linear) monotonic function of the linear predictors. GLMs also relax the assumption that the response variable is normally distributed by allowing for many distributions (e.g. normal, poisson, binomial, log-linear, etc.). Generalized additive models (GAMs) are extensions of GLMs. GAMs allow for the estimation of regression coefficients that take the form of non-parametric smoothers. Nonparametric smoothers like lowess (locally weighted scatterplot smoothing) fit a smooth curve to data using localized subsets of the data. This course provides an overview of modeling GLMs and GAMs using R. GLMs, and especially GAMs, have evolved into standard statistical methodologies of considerable flexibility. The course addresses recent approaches to modeling, estimating and interpreting GAMs. The focus of the course is on modeling and interpreting GLMs and especially GAMs with R. Use of the freely available R software illustrates the practicalities of linear, generalized linear, and generalized additive models.","Students will need to install R and R Commander software but ample instruction for doing so is provided.","https://www.udemy.com/linear-regression-glms-and-gams-with-r/","Understand the assumptions of ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression.,Specify, estimate and interpret linear (regression) models using R.,Understand how the assumptions of OLS regression are modified (relaxed) in order to specify, estimate and interpret generalized linear models (GLMs).,Specify, estimate and interpret GLMs using R.,Understand the mechanics and limitations of specifying, estimating and interpreting generalized additive models (GAMs)."

We examine three case studies which together present a broad-based tour of the basic and extended tasks of data mining in three different domains: (1) predicting algae blooms; (2) detecting fraudulent sales transactions; and (3) predicting stock market returns. The cumulative ""hands-on"" 3-course fifteen sessions showcase the use of Luis Torgo's amazingly useful ""Data Mining with R"" (DMwR) package and R software. Everything that you see on-screen is included with the course: all of the R scripts; all of the data files and R objects used and/or referenced; as well as all of the R packages' documentation. You can be new to R software and/or to data mining and be successful in completing the course. The first case study, Predicting Algae Blooms , provides instruction regarding the many useful, unique data mining functions contained in the R software 'DMwR' package. For the algae blooms prediction case, we specifically look at the tasks of data pre-processing, exploratory data analysis, and predictive model construction. For individuals completely new to R, the first two sessions of the algae blooms case (almost 4 hours of video and materials) provide an accelerated introduction to the use of R and RStudio and to basic techniques for inputting and outputting data and text. Detecting Fraudulent Transactions is the second extended data mining case study that showcases the DMwR (Data Mining with R) package. The case is specific but may be generalized to a common business problem: How does one sift through mountains of data (401,124 records, in this case) and identify suspicious data entries, or ""outliers""? The case problem is very unstructured, and walks through a wide variety of approaches and techniques in the attempt to discriminate the ""normal"", or ""ok"" transactions, from the abnormal, suspicious, or ""fraudulent"" transactions. This case presents a large number of alternative modeling approaches, some of which are appropriate for supervised, some for unsupervised, and some for semi-supervised data scenarios. The third extended case, Predicting Stock Market Returns is a data mining case study addressing the domain of automatic stock trading systems. These four sessions address the tasks of building an automated stock trading system based on prediction models that utilize daily stock quote data. The goal is to predict future returns for the S&P 500 market index. The resulting predictions are used together with a trading strategy to make decisions about generating market buy and sell orders. The case examines prediction problems that stem from the time ordering among data observations, that is, from the use of time series data. It also exemplifies the difficulties involved in translating model predictions into decisions and actions in the context of 'real-world' business applications.","Students will need to install no-cost R software and the no-cost RStudio IDE (instructions are provided).","https://www.udemy.com/case-studies-in-data-mining-with-r/","Understand how to implement and evaluate a variety of predictive data mining models in three different domains, each described as extended case studies: (1) harmful plant growth; (2) fraudulent transaction detection; and (3) stock market index changes.,Perform sophisticated data mining analyses using the ""Data Mining with R"" (DMwR) package and R software.,Have a greatly expanded understanding of the use of R software as a comprehensive data mining tool and platform.,Understand how to implement and evaluate supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning algorithms."

People who only have a Mac computer available to use should know that the R Commander interface is written in the R-specific RGtk2 language (based on GTK+) which is known to be problematic running on a Mac computer.","Comprehensive Linear Modeling with R provides a wide overview of numerous contemporary linear and non-linear modeling approaches for the analysis of research data. These include basic, conditional and simultaneous inference techniques; analysis of variance (ANOVA); linear regression; survival analysis; generalized linear models (GLMs); parametric and non-parametric smoothers and generalized additive models (GAMs); longitudinal and mixed-effects, split-plot and other nested model designs. The course showcases the use of R Commander in performing these tasks. R Commander is a popular GUI-based ""front-end"" to the broad range of embedded statistical functionality in R software. R Commander is an 'SPSS-like' GUI that enables the implementation of a large variety of statistical and graphical techniques using both menus and scripts. Please note that the R Commander GUI is written in the RGtk2 R-specific visual language (based on GTK+) which is known to have problems running on a Mac computer.,The course progresses through dozens of statistical techniques by first explaining the concepts and then demonstrating the use of each with concrete examples based on actual studies and research data. Beginning with a quick overview of different graphical plotting techniques, the course then reviews basic approaches to establish inference and conditional inference, followed by a review of analysis of variance (ANOVA). The course then progresses through linear regression and a section on validating linear models. Then generalized linear modeling (GLM) is explained and demonstrated with numerous examples. Also included are sections explaining and demonstrating linear and non-linear models for survival analysis, smoothers and generalized additive models (GAMs), longitudinal models with and without generalized estimating equations (GEE), mixed-effects, split-plot, and nested designs. Also included are detailed examples and explanations of validating linear models using various graphical displays, as well as comparing alternative models to choose the 'best' model. The course concludes with a section on the special considerations and techniques for establishing simultaneous inference in the linear modeling domain.,The rather long course aims for complete coverage of linear (and some non-linear) modeling approaches using R and is suitable for beginning, intermediate and advanced R users who seek to refine these skills. These candidates would include graduate students and/or quantitative and/or data-analytic professionals who perform linear (and non-linear) modeling as part of their professional duties.","Students will need to install R and R Commander using the ample video and written instructions that are provided for doing so.","https://www.udemy.com/comprehensive-linear-modeling-with-r/","Understand, use and apply, estimate, interpret and validate: ANOVA; regression; survival analysis; GLMs; smoothers and GAMs; longitudinal, mixed-effects, split-plot and nested model designs using their own data and R software.,Achieve proficiency using the popular no-cost and versatile R Commander GUI as an interface to the broad statistical and graphical capabilities in R.,Know and use tests for simple, conditional, and simultaneous inference.,Apply various graphs and plots to validate linear models.,Be able to compare and choose the 'best' among multiple competing models."

The course is best suited for both students and professionals who currently make use of quantitative or probabilistic modeling. It is useful to have a working knowledge of either basic inferential statistics or probability theory. It is NOT necessary to have prior experience using R software to successfully complete and to benefit from this course.","Bayesian Computational Analyses with R is an introductory course on the use and implementation of Bayesian modeling using R software. The Bayesian approach is an alternative to the ""frequentist"" approach where one simply takes a sample of data and makes inferences about the likely parameters of the population. In contrast, the Bayesian approach uses both likelihood functions and a sample of observed data (the 'prior') to estimate the most likely values and distributions for the estimated population parameters (the 'posterior'). The course is useful to anyone who wishes to learn about Bayesian concepts and is suited to both novice and intermediate Bayesian students and Bayesian practitioners. It is both a practical, ""hands-on"" course with many examples using R scripts and software, and is conceptual, as the course explains the Bayesian concepts. All materials, software, R scripts, slides, exercises and solutions are included with the course materials. It is helpful to have some grounding in basic inferential statistics and probability theory. No experience with R is necessary, although it is also helpful.,The course begins with an introductory section (12 video lessons) on using R and R 'scripting.' The introductory section is intended to introduce RStudio and R commands so that even a novice R user will be comfortable using R. Section 2 introduces the Bayesian Rule, with examples of both discrete and beta priors, predictive priors, and beta posteriors in Bayesian estimation. Section 3 explains and demonstrates the use of Bayesian estimation for single parameter models, for example, when one wishes to estimate the most likely value of a mean OR of a standard deviation (but not both). Section 4 explains and demonstrates the use of ""conjugate mixtures."" These are single-parameter models where the functional form of the prior and post are similar (for example, both normally distributed). But 'mixtures' imply there may be more than one component for the prior or posterior density functions. Mixtures enable the simultaneous test of competing, alternative theories as to which is more likely. Section 5 deals with multi-parameter Bayesian models where one is estimating the likelihood of more than one posterior variable value, for example, both mean AND standard deviation. Section 6 extends the Bayesian discussion by examining the estimation of integrals to estimate a probability. Section 7 covers the application the Bayesian approach to rejection and importance sampling and Section 8 looks at examples of comparing and validating Bayesian models.","Students will need to install R and RStudio software, but ample instruction for doing so is provided in the course materials.","https://www.udemy.com/bayesian-computational-analyses-with-r/","Understand Bayesian concepts, and gain a great deal of practical ""hands-on"" experience creating and estimating Bayesian models using R software.,Effectively use the Bayesian approach to estimate likely event outcomes, or probabilities, using their own data.,Be able to apply a range of Bayesian functions using R software in order to model and estimate single parameter, multi-parameter, conjugate mixture, multinomial, and rejection and importance sampling Bayesian models.,Understand and use both predictive priors and predictive posteriors in Bayesian applications.,Be able to compare and evaluate alternative, competing Bayesian models."

Often, both pre-analysis and post-analysis visualizations can help one understand “what is going on in the data"" in a way that looking at numerical summaries of fitted model estimates cannot. The lattice package in R is uniquely designed to graphically depict relationships in multivariate data sets.,This course describes and demonstrates this creative approach for constructing and drawing grid-based multivariate graphic plots and figures using R. Lattice graphics are characterized as multi-variable (3, 4, 5 or more variables) plots that use conditioning and paneling. Consequently, it is a popular approach for, and a good fit to visually present the results of multi-variable statistical model fitting. The appearance of most of the plots, graphs and figures are determined by panel functions, rather than by the high-level graphics function calls themselves. Further, the user of lattice graphics has extensive and comprehensive control over many more of the details and features of the visual plots, far greater control that is afforded by the base graphics approach in R. The method is based on trellis graphics which were popularized in the S language developed by Bell Labs.","Students will need to install R and RStudio (instructions are provided in the course materials).","https://www.udemy.com/multivariate-data-visualization-with-r/","Graphically depict visual 2D, 3D, 4D (and so on) relationships that exist in multivariate data sets.,Understand how ""trellis"" graphic objects are different from other graphic objects in R.,Understand how to apply the techniques of conditioning and paneling to present multivariate data relationships.,Understand the nature of lattice panel functions and know how to create and modify them for brilliant multivariate graphics displays.,Have a powerful visual toolset to visually present the results of multi-variable statistical model fitting."

Such systems are being used by companies such as Amazon, Facebook, Netflix, LinkedIn, Quora, Udemy, New York Times, etc. By taking this course, you will learn the most important of those tools, including how they work, how to use them, how to evaluate them, and their strengths and weaknesses in practice. The algorithms you will study include popularity-based systems, classification-based approach, collaborative filtering, matrix recommendation, etc.,Content and Overview,This course contains 23 lectures, 1 hour of content, 4 quizzes and one 11000 word e-book written by me. It is designed for anyone with an understanding of basic mathematics, who wishes to understand the technology behind the recommender systems they encounter every day. By taking this course you will establish a strong understanding of the concept behind recommender systems.,Starting with properly defining the goals of a recommender system, this course will show you numerous practical examples of where these systems are found in our daily lives. Then you will jump right into the action and start building your first recommender systems in the first section itself.,In the second section, you will move on to design more sophisticated systems and eventually learn how to develop a product recommendation system similar to Amazon. You will learn how to implement Collaborative Filtering, tackle the adverse effects of very popular items, construct and normalize the Co-occurrence matrix and leverage purchase histories for making better recommendations.,In the third section, you will learn how to develop a movie recommendation system like Netflix by Matrix Factorization. You will learn how to automatically construct “topic” vectors corresponding to users and movies that will help you in predicting movie ratings. Moreover, you will discover the infamous cold-start problem and understand how to solve it by blending or combining different recommendation approaches.,After making you familiar with popular recommender systems, the course will show you how to evaluate the performance of these systems by metrics such as precision and recall. You will know about optimal recommenders and learn how to make the best recommender in a constrained practical scenario.,Students completing the course will be literate in one of the most widely used tools of Machine Learning namely Recommender Systems.,They will be able to identify what recommender system is being used by a company whenever it markets an item (product, movie, news, etc.) to them. Moreover, if you want to design a recommender system for your own business or work, you will know by intuition which ones to try and how to evaluate and compare their performance before you select the final one.,The massive 11000-word e-book, which you receive as a part of this course not only contains the ideas taught in the lecture videos, but also has bonus materials that reinforce the concepts you have learned and give you new tricks to design recommender systems.","At least high school level math skills will be required.","https://www.udemy.com/learn-how-amazon-netflix-etc-give-you-recommendations/","An 11000-word e-book on recommender systems written by me,Describe the goals of a recommender system,Provide examples of applications where recommender systems are useful,Implement a popularity based recommender system like New York Times.,Implement a co-occurrence based product recommendation system like Amazon for your own business,Exploit ""topic"" vectors estimated by matrix factorization for implementing a movie recommendation system like Netflix,Describe the cold-start problem and offer ways to handle it (e.g., incorporating features),Analyze performance of various recommender systems in terms of precision and recall"

It is designed for people who want to become business analyst or do a lot of business analyses at their work. It is based on my 11 years of experience as a consultant in top consulting companies and as a Board Member responsible for strategy, improvement and turn-arounds in biggest companies from FMCG, SMG, B2B sector that I worked for. On the basis of what you will find in this course I have trained over 100 business analysts who now are Investment Directors, Senior Analyst, Directors in Consulting Companies, Board Members etc.,I teach through cases so most of the lectures will be a case study showing some business problem solved in Excel. To every lecture you will find attached (in additional resources) the Excel shown the specific business analysis shown in the Lecture. Thanks to this as a part of this course you will also get a library of ready-made business analyses that can, with certain modification, be applied by you in your work. Every business analysis show in this lecture is easy to edit and adjust to your need.,Why I decided to create this course?,The companies I have worked with so far as a Board Member (I am usually, Chief Restructuring Officer VP responsible for Strategy and Development) still have huge problem with proper analyzing intermediate and advance issues – they are usually preoccupied by current activities and have close to no time for business analysis and strategic decision. Moreover, they do not know how to approach many subject from the analytical point of view to make sure that they are taking the right decision. Therefore, quite often they hire consultants who in turn lack the practical knowledge and experience. This course is my small contribution to improving both consulting as well operational and strategic analyses in FMC, SMCG, B2B companies including also on-line models like e-commerce, SaaS, marketplaces.,In what way will you benefit from this course?,The course is a practical, step by step guide loaded with tones of analyses, tricks, hints that will significantly improve the speed with which you do the business analyses as well as the quality of the conclusions coming out of available in your company data.

You cannot escape it, it is too important. Unfortunately this topic is widely overlooked and information is hard to find.,With this course I will change this!,Data Pre-Processing as taught in this course has the following steps:,1. Data Import: this might sound trivial but if you consider all the different data formats out there you can imagine that this can be confusing. In the course we will take a look at a standard way of importing csv files, we will learn about the very fast fread method and I will show you what you can do if you have more exotic file formats to handle.,2. Selecting the object class: a standard data.frame might be fine for easy standard tasks, but there are more advanced classes out there like the data.table. Especially with those huge datasets nowadays, a data.frame might not do it anymore. Alternatives will be demonstrated in this course.,3. Getting your data in a tidy form: a tidy dataset has 1 row for each observation and 1 column for each variable. This might sound trivial, but in your daily work you will find instances where this simple rule is not followed. Often times you will not even notice that the dataset is not tidy in its layout. We will learn how tidyr can help you in getting your data into a clean and tidy format.,4. Querying and filtering: when you have a huge dataset you need to filter for the desired parameters. We will learn about the combination of parameters and implementation of advanced filtering methods. Especially data.table has proven effective for that sort of querying on huge datasets, therefore we will focus on this package in the querying section.,5. Data joins: when your data is spread over 2 different tables but you want to join them together based on given criteria, you will need joins for that. There are several methods of data joins in R, but here we will take a look at dplyr and the 2 table verbs which are such a great tool to work with 2 tables at the same time.,6. Integrating and interacting with SQL: R is great at interacting with SQL. And SQL is of course the leading database language, which you will have to learn sooner or later as a data scientist. I will show you how to use SQL code within R and there is even a R to SQL translator for standard R code. And we will set up a SQLite database from within R.,How do you best prepare yourself for this course?,You only need a basic knowledge of R to fully benefit from this course. Once you know the basics of RStudio and R you are ready to follow along with the course material.

Maybe it is not the most fancy or sophisticated one, yet it is universally understood by everybody especially your boss and your customers.,Excel is still pretty advanced tool with countless number of features and functions. I have mastered quite a lot of them during my studies and while working. After some time in consulting I discovered that most of them are not that useful; some of them bring more problems than solutions. On top of that there are features that we are taught at university that are not flexible and pretty time consuming. While working as a business analyst I developed my own set of tricks to deal with Excel I learned how to make my analyses idiot-proven and extremely universal.,I will NOT teach you the entire Excel as it is simply not efficient (and frankly you don’t need it). This course is organized around 80/20 rule and I want to teach you the most useful (from business analyst / consultant perspective) formulas as fast as possible. I want you also to acquire thanks to the course good habits in Excel that will save you loads of time.,If done properly, this course will transform you in 1 day into pretty good business analyst that knows how to use Excel in the smart way. It is based on my 12 years of experience as a consultant in top consulting companies and as a Board Member responsible for strategy, improvement and turn-arounds in biggest companies from FMCG, SMG, B2B sector that I worked for. On the basis of what you will find in this course I have trained over 100 business analysts who now are Investment Directors, Senior Analyst, Directors in Consulting Companies, Board Members etc.,I teach step by step on the basis of Excel files that will be attached to the course. To make the best out of the course you should follow my steps and repeat what I do with the data after every lecture. Don’t move to the next lecture if you have not done what I show in the lecture that you have gone through.,I assume that you know basic Excel so the basic features (i.e. how to write formula in Excel) are not explained in this course. I concentrate on intermediate and advanced solutions and purposefully get rid of some things that are advanced yet later become very inflexible and useless (i.e. naming the variables). At the end, I will show 4 full blown analyses in Excel that use the tricks that I show in the lectures.,To every lecture you will find attached (in additional resources) the Excel shown in the Lecture so as a part of this course you will also get a library of ready-made analyses that can, with certain modification, be applied by you in your work.,Why I decided to create this course?,I have done number of courses showing you how to analyze data in Excel. Yet, I have noticed that some students lack the fluency of operations in Excel. This course is designed to fill in the gap and help you fully appreciate my other courses for business analysts and consultants. It can be used also as standalone course that will help you to be smart in Excel,In what way will you benefit from this course?,The course is a practical, step by step guide loaded with tones of analyses, tricks, hints that will significantly improve the speed with which you do the analyses as well as the quality of the conclusions coming out of available in your company data.

You should have a beginner to intermediate understanding of Python as I don't spend a lot of time on the programming aspect.,Most data in the world (whether text,audio,visual, etc) is raw or unlabeled . This is precisely the reason that unsupervised machine learning has become so important. By using certain approaches to unsupervised machine learning (like clusterin g) we can discover patterns or underlying structures in data. This is a major component of exploratory data mining . Furthermore, when one does exploratory data mining, it is used to draw hypotheses, assess assumptions about our statistical inferences, and its used as a basis for further research. For example, the conclusion of a cluster analysis could result in the initiation of a full scale experiment.,The course covers two of the most important and common non-hierarchical clustering algorithms , K-means and DBSCAN using Python.,With K-Means, we start with a 'starter' (or simple) example. We then discuss 'Completeness Score'. The next lesson we discuss how k-means deals with larger variances and different shapes. Then we discuss 'Color Quantization' . This is used when an individual wants to decrease the size of an image/and or see if there is any underlying structure to an image. Finally, we will take a look at cells of the human body, and do some cell segmentation. For DBSCAN, we will look at a starter example as well using Blobs. Then I will show you how DBSCAN overcomes some of the issues of K-means.,If you are interested in data mining, and want to get a taste of how it works, this course is a great introduction!","Understanding Python at beginner or intermediate level is mandatory.","https://www.udemy.com/clusteranalysisandunsupervisedmachinelearningwithpython/","Apply kmeans clustering,Apply DBSCAN clustering,Appreciate and understand the purpose of unsupervised machine learning"

On some projects you may be producing as much as 200-300 slides. Slide preparation is very time-consuming and you have to make sure that you structure you work properly to deliver according to promised deadlines.,In this course you will learn how to prepare a great presentation for your customer that will help you deliver your thoughts in a coherent manner and win him over. I will teach you how to prepare the the presentation in the right order so you do not waste your time. You will also learn what type of slides you can consider and when you should use a specific type of slide.,This course is based on my 12 years of experience as a consultant in top consulting companies and as a Board Member responsible for strategy, improvement and turn-arounds in biggest companies from FMCG, SMG, B2B sector that I worked for. I have not only delivered presentations on numerous projects myself but I was also receiving presentations from consulting companies such as PwC, BCG, McKinsey, EY, Accenture, OCC as a Board Member in many companies. I have seen the process of preparing and delivering presentations form all angles. On the basis of what you will find in this course and I have trained over 100 business analysts and consultants who now are Investment Directors, Senior Analyst, Directors in Consulting Companies, Board Members etc.,I teach through cases, using 80/20 rule so most of the lectures will be case studies showing examples of how to put something on a slide. Those slides are based on real life examples. You will also learn the order in which you should do things in order to deliver nice, coherent, understood by your customer presentations within the deadlines. To every lecture you will also find attached additional resources. Thanks to this, as a part of this course you will also get a library of ready-made materials that will help you in your first year as a business analyst / junior consultant.,Why I decided to create this course?,Presentations are not something people learn in school or even universities. For most people it is difficult to read presentations and to express themselves using slides. Many people, experience also in the beginning problems in proper structuring of the whole presentation. They cannot make it understandable for the customer and quite often the presentation lacks the flow. The biggest problem in consulting is that the presentation is determining the analyses that you have to make. If your presentation draft is not well structured and though-through you will not be efficient with interviews, data gathering and analyses. Therefore, I found it critical to teach all my co-workers and employees how to express themselves. In this way I made their work (not only related to presentation) much more efficient and also my life much easier :) . Learn from this course and apply it also in your work,In what way will you benefit from this course?,The course is a practical, step by step guide loaded with tones of cases, tricks, hints that will significantly improve the speed with which you work. You will learn how to prepare a great presentation both for internal as well as external purposes. There is little theory – mainly examples, a lot of tips from my own experience as well as other notable examples worth mentioning. My intention is that thanks to the course you will know:,You can also ask me any question either through the discussion mode or by messaging me directly.,How the course is organized?,The course is divided currently in 7 sections and I will be adding new section to address other important issues.

You’d want that robot to be able to explore the world on its own, and learn things just by looking for patterns.,Do you ever wonder how we get the data that we use in our supervised machine learning algorithms?,We always seem to have a nice CSV or a table, complete with Xs and corresponding Ys.,If you haven’t been involved in acquiring data yourself, you might not have thought about this, but someone has to make this data!,Those “Y”s have to come from somewhere, and a lot of the time that involves manual labor.,Sometimes, you don’t have access to this kind of information or it is infeasible or costly to acquire.,But you still want to have some idea of the structure of the data. If you're doing data analytics automating pattern recognition in your data would be invaluable.,This is where unsupervised machine learning comes into play.,In this course we are first going to talk about clustering. This is where instead of training on labels, we try to create our own labels! We’ll do this by grouping together data that looks alike.,There are 2 methods of clustering we’ll talk about: k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering .,Next, because in machine learning we like to talk about probability distributions, we’ll go into Gaussian mixture models and kernel density estimation , where we talk about how to ""learn"" the probability distribution of a set of data.,One interesting fact is that under certain conditions, Gaussian mixture models and k-means clustering are exactly the same! We’ll prove how this is the case.,All the algorithms we’ll talk about in this course are staples in machine learning and data science, so if you want to know how to automatically find patterns in your data with data mining and pattern extraction, without needing someone to put in manual work to label that data, then this course is for you.,All the materials for this course are FREE.

But when you ask yourself, what is my position with respect to this new industrial revolution, that might lead you to another fundamental question: am I a consumer or a creator? For most people nowadays, the answer would be, a consumer.,But what if you could also become a creator?,What if there was a way for you to easily break into the World of Artificial Intelligence and build amazing applications which leverage the latest technology to make the World a better place?,Sounds too good to be true, doesn't it?,But there actually is a way..,Computer Vision is by far the easiest way of becoming a creator.,And it's not only the easiest way, it's also the branch of AI where there is the most to create.,Why? You'll ask.,That's because Computer Vision is applied everywhere. From health to retail to entertainment - the list goes on. Computer Vision is already a $18 Billion market and is growing exponentially.,Just think of tumor detection in patient MRI brain scans. How many more lives are saved every day simply because a computer can analyze 10,000x more images than a human?,And what if you find an industry where Computer Vision is not yet applied? Then all the better! That means there's a business opportunity which you can take advantage of.,So now that raises the question: how do you break into the World of Computer Vision?,Up until now, computer vision has for the most part been a maze. A growing maze.,As the number of codes, libraries and tools in CV grows, it becomes harder and harder to not get lost.,On top of that, not only do you need to know how to use it - you also need to know how it works to maximise the advantage of using Computer Vision.,To this problem we want to bring...,Computer Vision A-Z.,With this brand new course you will not only learn how the most popular computer vision methods work, but you will also learn to apply them in practice!,Can't wait to see you inside the class,,Kirill & Hadelin","Only High School Maths","https://www.udemy.com/computer-vision-a-z/","Have a toolbox of the most powerful Computer Vision models,Understand the theory behind Computer Vision,Master OpenCV,Master Object Detection,Master Facial Recognition,Create powerful Computer Vision applications"

We will treat you as a beginner when it comes to MapReduce and getting everything set up for writing MapReduce jobs with Python, MRJob, and Amazon's Elastic MapReduce service - but we won't spend a lot of time teaching you how to write code. The focus is on framing data analysis problems as MapReduce problems and running them either locally or on a Hadoop cluster. If you don't know Python, you'll need to be able to pick it up based on the examples we give. If you're new to programming, you'll want to learn a programming or scripting language before taking this course.","“Big data"" analysis is a hot and highly valuable skill – and this course will teach you two technologies fundamental to big data quickly: MapReduce and Hadoop . Ever wonder how Google manages to analyze the entire Internet on a continual basis? You'll learn those same techniques, using your own Windows system right at home.,Learn and master the art of framing data analysis problems as MapReduce problems through over 10 hands-on examples , and then scale them up to run on cloud computing services in this course. You'll be learning from an ex-engineer and senior manager from Amazon and IMDb.,By the end of this course, you'll be running code that analyzes gigabytes worth of information – in the cloud – in a matter of minutes.,We'll have some fun along the way. You'll get warmed up with some simple examples of using MapReduce to analyze movie ratings data and text in a book. Once you've got the basics under your belt, we'll move to some more complex and interesting tasks. We'll use a million movie ratings to find movies that are similar to each other, and you might even discover some new movies you might like in the process! We'll analyze a social graph of superheroes, and learn who the most “popular"" superhero is – and develop a system to find “degrees of separation"" between superheroes. Are all Marvel superheroes within a few degrees of being connected to The Incredible Hulk? You'll find the answer.,This course is very hands-on; you'll spend most of your time following along with the instructor as we write, analyze, and run real code together – both on your own system, and in the cloud using Amazon's Elastic MapReduce service. Over 5 hours of video content is included, with over 10 real examples of increasing complexity you can build, run and study yourself . Move through them at your own pace, on your own schedule.

Stock prices are sequences of prices. Language is a sequence of words. Credit scoring involves sequences of borrowing and repaying money, and we can use those sequences to predict whether or not you’re going to default. In short, sequences are everywhere, and being able to analyze them is an important skill in your data science toolbox.,The easiest way to appreciate the kind of information you get from a sequence is to consider what you are reading right now. If I had written the previous sentence backwards, it wouldn’t make much sense to you, even though it contained all the same words. So order is important.,While the current fad in deep learning is to use recurrent neural networks to model sequences, I want to first introduce you guys to a machine learning algorithm that has been around for several decades now - the Hidden Markov Model.,This course follows directly from my first course in Unsupervised Machine Learning for Cluster Analysis , where you learned how to measure the probability distribution of a random variable . In this course, you’ll learn to measure the probability distribution of a sequence of random variables.,You guys know how much I love deep learning , so there is a little twist in this course. We’ve already covered gradient descent and you know how central it is for solving deep learning problems. I claimed that gradient descent could be used to optimize any objective function. In this course I will show you how you can use gradient descent to solve for the optimal parameters of an HMM, as an alternative to the popular expectation-maximization algorithm.,We’re going to do it in Theano and Tensorflow , which are popular libraries for deep learning. This is also going to teach you how to work with sequences in Theano and Tensorflow, which will be very useful when we cover recurrent neural networks and LSTMs .,This course is also going to go through the many practical applications of Markov models and hidden Markov models. We’re going to look at a model of sickness and health, and calculate how to predict how long you’ll stay sick, if you get sick. We’re going to talk about how Markov models can be used to analyze how people interact with your website, and fix problem areas like high bounce rate , which could be affecting your SEO . We’ll build language models that can be used to identify a writer and even generate text - imagine a machine doing your writing for you. HMMs have been very successful in natural language processing or NLP .,We’ll look at what is possibly the most recent and prolific application of Markov models - Google’s PageRank algorithm. And finally we’ll discuss even more practical applications of Markov models, including generating images, smartphone autosuggestions , and using HMMs to answer one of the most fundamental questions in biology - how is DNA , the code of life, translated into physical or behavioral attributes of an organism?,All of the materials of this course can be downloaded and installed for FREE.

I’ve done a lot of courses about deep learning, and I just released a course about unsupervised learning , where I talked about clustering and density estimation . So what do you get when you put these 2 together? Unsupervised deep learning!,In these course we’ll start with some very basic stuff - principal components analysis (PCA) , and a popular nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique known as t-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding) .,Next, we’ll look at a special type of unsupervised neural network called the autoencoder . After describing how an autoencoder works, I’ll show you how you can link a bunch of them together to form a deep stack of autoencoders, that leads to better performance of a supervised deep neural network . Autoencoders are like a non-linear form of PCA.,Last, we’ll look at restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) . These are yet another popular unsupervised neural network, that you can use in the same way as autoencoders to pretrain your supervised deep neural network. I’ll show you an interesting way of training restricted Boltzmann machines, known as Gibbs sampling , a special case of Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and I’ll demonstrate how even though this method is only a rough approximation, it still ends up reducing other cost functions, such as the one used for autoencoders. This method is also known as Contrastive Divergence or CD-k . As in physical systems, we define a concept called free energy and attempt to minimize this quantity.,Finally, we’ll bring all these concepts together and I’ll show you visually what happens when you use PCA and t-SNE on the features that the autoencoders and RBMs have learned, and we’ll see that even without labels the results suggest that a pattern has been found.,All the materials used in this course are FREE. Since this course is the 4th in the deep learning series, I will assume you already know calculus, linear algebra, and Python coding. You'll want to install Numpy, Theano, and Tensorflow for this course.

You already know how to build an artificial neural network in Python, and you have a plug-and-play script that you can use for TensorFlow. Neural networks are one of the staples of machine learning, and they are always a top contender in Kaggle contests. If you want to improve your skills with neural networks and deep learning, this is the course for you.,You already learned about backpropagation, but there were a lot of unanswered questions. How can you modify it to improve training speed? In this course you will learn about batch and stochastic gradient descent , two commonly used techniques that allow you to train on just a small sample of the data at each iteration, greatly speeding up training time.,You will also learn about momentum , which can be helpful for carrying you through local minima and prevent you from having to be too conservative with your learning rate. You will also learn about adaptive learning rate techniques like AdaGrad , RMSprop , and Adam which can also help speed up your training.,Because you already know about the fundamentals of neural networks, we are going to talk about more modern techniques, like dropout regularization and batch normalization , which we will implement in both TensorFlow and Theano. The course is constantly being updated and more advanced regularization techniques are coming in the near future.,In my last course, I just wanted to give you a little sneak peak at TensorFlow . In this course we are going to start from the basics so you understand exactly what's going on - what are TensorFlow variables and expressions and how can you use these building blocks to create a neural network? We are also going to look at a library that's been around much longer and is very popular for deep learning - Theano . With this library we will also examine the basic building blocks - variables, expressions, and functions - so that you can build neural networks in Theano with confidence.,Theano was the predecessor to all modern deep learning libraries today. Today, we have almost TOO MANY options. Keras , PyTorch , CNTK (Microsoft), MXNet (Amazon / Apache), etc. In this course, we cover all of these!

There is no doubt about that. Self-driving cars are clocking up millions of miles, IBM Watson is diagnosing patients better than armies of doctors and Google Deepmind's AlphaGo beat the World champion at Go - a game where intuition plays a key role.,But the further AI advances, the more complex become the problems it needs to solve. And only Deep Learning can solve such complex problems and that's why it's at the heart of Artificial intelligence.,--- Why Deep Learning A-Z? ---,Here are five reasons we think Deep Learning A-Z™ really is different, and stands out from the crowd of other training programs out there:,1. ROBUST STRUCTURE,The first and most important thing we focused on is giving the course a robust structure. Deep Learning is very broad and complex and to navigate this maze you need a clear and global vision of it.,That's why we grouped the tutorials into two volumes, representing the two fundamental branches of Deep Learning: Supervised Deep Learning and Unsupervised Deep Learning. With each volume focusing on three distinct algorithms, we found that this is the best structure for mastering Deep Learning.,2. INTUITION TUTORIALS,So many courses and books just bombard you with the theory, and math, and coding... But they forget to explain, perhaps, the most important part: why you are doing what you are doing. And that's how this course is so different. We focus on developing an intuitive *feel* for the concepts behind Deep Learning algorithms.,With our intuition tutorials you will be confident that you understand all the techniques on an instinctive level. And once you proceed to the hands-on coding exercises you will see for yourself how much more meaningful your experience will be. This is a game-changer.,3. EXCITING PROJECTS,Are you tired of courses based on over-used, outdated data sets?,Yes? Well then you're in for a treat.,Inside this class we will work on Real-World datasets, to solve Real-World business problems. (Definitely not the boring iris or digit classification datasets that we see in every course). In this course we will solve six real-world challenges:,*Stacked Autoencoders is a brand new technique in Deep Learning which didn't even exist a couple of years ago. We haven't seen this method explained anywhere else in sufficient depth.,4. HANDS-ON CODING,In Deep Learning A-Z™ we code together with you. Every practical tutorial starts with a blank page and we write up the code from scratch. This way you can follow along and understand exactly how the code comes together and what each line means.,In addition, we will purposefully structure the code in such a way so that you can download it and apply it in your own projects. Moreover, we explain step-by-step where and how to modify the code to insert YOUR dataset, to tailor the algorithm to your needs, to get the output that you are after.,This is a course which naturally extends into your career.,5. IN-COURSE SUPPORT,Have you ever taken a course or read a book where you have questions but cannot reach the author?,Well, this course is different. We are fully committed to making this the most disruptive and powerful Deep Learning course on the planet. With that comes a responsibility to constantly be there when you need our help.,In fact, since we physically also need to eat and sleep we have put together a team of professional Data Scientists to help us out. Whenever you ask a question you will get a response from us within 48 hours maximum.,No matter how complex your query, we will be there. The bottom line is we want you to succeed.,--- The Tools ---,Tensorflow and Pytorch are the two most popular open-source libraries for Deep Learning. In this course you will learn both!,TensorFlow was developed by Google and is used in their speech recognition system, in the new google photos product, gmail, google search and much more. Companies using Tensorflow include AirBnb, Airbus, Ebay, Intel, Uber and dozens more.,PyTorch is as just as powerful and is being developed by researchers at Nvidia and leading universities: Stanford, Oxford, ParisTech. Companies using PyTorch include Twitter, Saleforce and Facebook.,So which is better and for what?,Well, in this course you will have an opportunity to work with both and understand when Tensorflow is better and when PyTorch is the way to go. Throughout the tutorials we compare the two and give you tips and ideas on which could work best in certain circumstances.,The interesting thing is that both these libraries are barely over 1 year old. That's what we mean when we say that in this course we teach you the most cutting edge Deep Learning models and techniques.,--- More Tools ---,Theano is another open source deep learning library. It's very similar to Tensorflow in its functionality, but nevertheless we will still cover it.,Keras is an incredible library to implement Deep Learning models. It acts as a wrapper for Theano and Tensorflow. Thanks to Keras we can create powerful and complex Deep Learning models with only a few lines of code. This is what will allow you to have a global vision of what you are creating. Everything you make will look so clear and structured thanks to this library, that you will really get the intuition and understanding of what you are doing.,--- Even More Tools ---,Scikit-learn the most practical Machine Learning library. We will mainly use it:,And of course, we have to mention the usual suspects. This whole course is based on Python and in every single section you will be getting hours and hours of invaluable hands-on practical coding experience.,Plus, throughout the course we will be using Numpy to do high computations and manipulate high dimensional arrays, Matplotlib to plot insightful charts and Pandas to import and manipulate datasets the most efficiently.,--- Who Is This Course For? ---,As you can see, there are lots of different tools in the space of Deep Learning and in this course we make sure to show you the most important and most progressive ones so that when you're done with Deep Learning A-Z™ your skills are on the cutting edge of today's technology.,If you are just starting out into Deep Learning, then you will find this course extremely useful. Deep Learning A-Z™ is structured around special coding blueprint approaches meaning that you won't get bogged down in unnecessary programming or mathematical complexities and instead you will be applying Deep Learning techniques from very early on in the course. You will build your knowledge from the ground up and you will see how with every tutorial you are getting more and more confident.,If you already have experience with Deep Learning, you will find this course refreshing, inspiring and very practical. Inside Deep Learning A-Z™ you will master some of the most cutting-edge Deep Learning algorithms and techniques (some of which didn't even exist a year ago) and through this course you will gain an immense amount of valuable hands-on experience with real-world business challenges. Plus, inside you will find inspiration to explore new Deep Learning skills and applications.,--- Real-World Case Studies ---,Mastering Deep Learning is not just about knowing the intuition and tools, it's also about being able to apply these models to real-world scenarios and derive actual measurable results for the business or project. That's why in this course we are introducing six exciting challenges:,#1 Churn Modelling Problem,In this part you will be solving a data analytics challenge for a bank. You will be given a dataset with a large sample of the bank's customers. To make this dataset, the bank gathered information such as customer id, credit score, gender, age, tenure, balance, if the customer is active, has a credit card, etc. During a period of 6 months, the bank observed if these customers left or stayed in the bank.,Your goal is to make an Artificial Neural Network that can predict, based on geo-demographical and transactional information given above, if any individual customer will leave the bank or stay (customer churn). Besides, you are asked to rank all the customers of the bank, based on their probability of leaving. To do that, you will need to use the right Deep Learning model, one that is based on a probabilistic approach.,If you succeed in this project, you will create significant added value to the bank. By applying your Deep Learning model the bank may significantly reduce customer churn.,#2 Image Recognition,In this part, you will create a Convolutional Neural Network that is able to detect various objects in images. We will implement this Deep Learning model to recognize a cat or a dog in a set of pictures. However, this model can be reused to detect anything else and we will show you how to do it - by simply changing the pictures in the input folder.,For example, you will be able to train the same model on a set of brain images, to detect if they contain a tumor or not. But if you want to keep it fitted to cats and dogs, then you will literally be able to a take a picture of your cat or your dog, and your model will predict which pet you have. We even tested it out on Hadelin’s dog!,#3 Stock Price Prediction,In this part, you will create one of the most powerful Deep Learning models. We will even go as far as saying that you will create the Deep Learning model closest to “Artificial Intelligence” . Why is that? Because this model will have long-term memory, just like us, humans.,The branch of Deep Learning which facilitates this is Recurrent Neural Networks. Classic RNNs have short memory, and were neither popular nor powerful for this exact reason. But a recent major improvement in Recurrent Neural Networks gave rise to the popularity of LSTMs (Long Short Term Memory RNNs) which has completely changed the playing field. We are extremely excited to include these cutting-edge deep learning methods in our course!,In this part you will learn how to implement this ultra-powerful model, and we will take the challenge to use it to predict the real Google stock price. A similar challenge has already been faced by researchers at Stanford University and we will aim to do at least as good as them.,#4 Fraud Detection,According to a recent report published by Markets & Markets the Fraud Detection and Prevention Market is going to be worth $33.19 Billion USD by 2021. This is a huge industry and the demand for advanced Deep Learning skills is only going to grow. That’s why we have included this case study in the course.,This is the first part of Volume 2 - Unsupervised Deep Learning Models. The business challenge here is about detecting fraud in credit card applications. You will be creating a Deep Learning model for a bank and you are given a dataset that contains information on customers applying for an advanced credit card.,This is the data that customers provided when filling the application form. Your task is to detect potential fraud within these applications. That means that by the end of the challenge, you will literally come up with an explicit list of customers who potentially cheated on their applications.,#5 & 6 Recommender Systems,From Amazon product suggestions to Netflix movie recommendations - good recommender systems are very valuable in today's World. And specialists who can create them are some of the top-paid Data Scientists on the planet.,We will work on a dataset that has exactly the same features as the Netflix dataset: plenty of movies, thousands of users, who have rated the movies they watched. The ratings go from 1 to 5, exactly like in the Netflix dataset, which makes the Recommender System more complex to build than if the ratings were simply “Liked” or “Not Liked”.,Your final Recommender System will be able to predict the ratings of the movies the customers didn’t watch. Accordingly, by ranking the predictions from 5 down to 1, your Deep Learning model will be able to recommend which movies each user should watch. Creating such a powerful Recommender System is quite a challenge so we will give ourselves two shots. Meaning we will build it with two different Deep Learning models.,Our first model will be Deep Belief Networks, complex Boltzmann Machines that will be covered in Part 5. Then our second model will be with the powerful AutoEncoders, my personal favorites. You will appreciate the contrast between their simplicity, and what they are capable of.,And you will even be able to apply it to yourself or your friends. The list of movies will be explicit so you will simply need to rate the movies you already watched, input your ratings in the dataset, execute your model and voila! The Recommender System will tell you exactly which movies you would love one night you if are out of ideas of what to watch on Netflix!,--- Summary ---,In conclusion, this is an exciting training program filled with intuition tutorials, practical exercises and real-World case studies.,We are super enthusiastic about Deep Learning and hope to see you inside the class!,Kirill & Hadelin","Just some high school mathematics level","https://www.udemy.com/deeplearning/","Understand the intuition behind Artificial Neural Networks,Apply Artificial Neural Networks in practice,Understand the intuition behind Convolutional Neural Networks,Apply Convolutional Neural Networks in practice,Understand the intuition behind Recurrent Neural Networks,Apply Recurrent Neural Networks in practice,Understand the intuition behind Self-Organizing Maps,Apply Self-Organizing Maps in practice,Understand the intuition behind Boltzmann Machines,Apply Boltzmann Machines in practice,Understand the intuition behind AutoEncoders,Apply AutoEncoders in practice"

If you are a student or professional who wants to apply deep learning to time series or sequence data, take this course. If you want to learn about word embeddings and language modeling, take this course. If you want to improve the performance you got with Hidden Markov Models, take this course. If you're interested the techniques that led to new developments in machine translation, take this course. If you have no idea about deep learning, don't take this course, take the prerequisites.","Like the course I just released on Hidden Markov Models , Recurrent Neural Networks are all about learning sequences - but whereas Markov Models are limited by the Markov assumption, Recurrent Neural Networks are not - and as a result, they are more expressive, and more powerful than anything we’ve seen on tasks that we haven’t made progress on in decades.,So what’s going to be in this course and how will it build on the previous neural network courses and Hidden Markov Models?,In the first section of the course we are going to add the concept of time to our neural networks.,I’ll introduce you to the Simple Recurrent Unit , also known as the Elman unit .,We are going to revisit the XOR problem, but we’re going to extend it so that it becomes the parity problem - you’ll see that regular feedforward neural networks will have trouble solving this problem but recurrent networks will work because the key is to treat the input as a sequence.,In the next section of the course, we are going to revisit one of the most popular applications of recurrent neural networks - language modeling .,You saw when we studied Markov Models that we could do things like generate poetry and it didn’t look too bad. We could even discriminate between 2 different poets just from the sequence of parts-of-speech tags they used.,In this course, we are going to extend our language model so that it no longer makes the Markov assumption.,Another popular application of neural networks for language is word vectors or word embeddings . The most common technique for this is called Word2Vec , but I’ll show you how recurrent neural networks can also be used for creating word vectors.,In the section after, we’ll look at the very popular LSTM , or long short-term memory unit , and the more modern and efficient GRU , or gated recurrent unit , which has been proven to yield comparable performance.,We’ll apply these to some more practical problems, such as learning a language model from Wikipedia data and visualizing the word embeddings we get as a result.,All of the materials required for this course can be downloaded and installed for FREE. We will do most of our work in Numpy, Matplotlib , and Theano . I am always available to answer your questions and help you along your data science journey.,This course focuses on "" how to build and understand "", not just ""how to use"". Anyone can learn to use an API in 15 minutes after reading some documentation. It's not about ""remembering facts"", it's about ""seeing for yourself"" via experimentation . It will teach you how to visualize what's happening in the model internally. If you want more than just a superficial look at machine learning models, this course is for you.,See you in class!,NOTES:,All the code for this course can be downloaded from my github: /lazyprogrammer/machine_learning_examples,In the directory: rnn_class,Make sure you always ""git pull"" so you have the latest version!,HARD PREREQUISITES / KNOWLEDGE YOU ARE ASSUMED TO HAVE:,TIPS (for getting through the course):,USEFUL COURSE ORDERING:","Calculus,Linear algebra,Python, Numpy, Matplotlib,Write a neural network in Theano,Understand backpropagation,Probability (conditional and joint distributions),Write a neural network in Tensorflow","https://www.udemy.com/deep-learning-recurrent-neural-networks-in-python/","Understand the simple recurrent unit (Elman unit),Understand the GRU (gated recurrent unit),Understand the LSTM (long short-term memory unit),Write various recurrent networks in Theano,Understand backpropagation through time,Understand how to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem,Solve the XOR and parity problems using a recurrent neural network,Use recurrent neural networks for language modeling,Use RNNs for generating text, like poetry,Visualize word embeddings and look for patterns in word vector representations"
