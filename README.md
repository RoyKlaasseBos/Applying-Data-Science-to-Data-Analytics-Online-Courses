# Intro to Machine Learning (JBP040)
In recent years online education has taken a flight: universities throughout the world have published their Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) on platforms such as Coursera and edX. While aforementioned platforms offer academics an online stage other platforms can be described as marketplaces where basically anyone can become an online instructor. One example of such a platform is Udemy which offers 55,000 courses, just hit the 15-million students mark and is still growing rapidly.

This rise in popularity also comes with new challenges. Due to network effects and increased student demand platforms attract more and more creators which makes it for teachers even more challenging to differentiate from the many already existing courses. Creating a course from scratch requires a significant upfront time investment while the final pay-off remains uncertain. Therefore teachers can benefit from insights into what course characteristics are positively related to their expected student base by estimating the total addressable market. From a commercial standpoint platforms can also benefit from these insights. For example, to decide what courses to promote on their website, since the screen space is very limited given the total number of courses. Further, Udemy has an interest in keeping students satisfied which becomes directly apparent from the many course reviews. By analysing and finding patterns in the abundance of reviews, they can support teachers in improving their current courses and developing even better ones in the future.

This project addresses the following descriptive questions: 
1. Is there a positive relationship between the number of hours of video and the number of students enrolled in the course (since they get more value for their money)? Does this relationship also hold for free courses?
2. Is the average star-rating for free courses higher than for paid courses since stu- dents have di↵erent expectations for a free course (i.e. they are more lenient)?
3. Do courses with a relatively high star-rating attract significantly more students?
4. Is there no relationship between the original course price and the number of students enrolled due to Udemy’s extreme discount policy?
5. Are there significantly fewer students enrolled in courses of an intermediate or expert level (since they exclude beginners)?
6. Do English spoken courses attract significantly more students compared to non- English spoken ones?
7. Is there a positive relationship between the average star rating across all courses and the number of courses created by the teacher (because he/she gains more experience over time)?

..and investigates to what extent it is possbile to predict the *number of students enrolled* and the *course star-rating*.
